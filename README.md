# Magic-Wizard-Password
Module 3 Challenge
In this challenge we were tasked with creating a password generator.
I was given starter code that had html and css already.
Javascript was also included but other functions needed to be added to make it work.
I added the generatePassword function to the script.
Now the password generator asks the user prompts about they password they want generated.
The password generator function runs over a for loop fpr the length of the array that the user selected.
Ive tested the password generator by changing variables and trying to add paparmeters outside of the acceptance criteria.
